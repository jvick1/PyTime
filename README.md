# Python Script with Logging

This Python script is designed to run a specific task and log the execution time along with the date of execution into a text file.

## Setup

Before running the script, ensure you update the `path` variable to your desired path and create a `logs` folder within that path.

```python
# Update the path variable with your desired path
path = 'YOUR PATH'
```

## Usage

1. Update the path variable with your desired path.
2. Create a logs folder within the specified path.
3. Execute the Python script.

## Logging
The script logs the following information:

- Date and time of execution
- Execution time in seconds
- User notes (optional)
  
The log entries are appended to a logs.txt file located within the logs folder.
